Humble Bundle Steam Product Code Cleaner
https://github.com/spencergoodin

This script uses Python 3.10, however any version of Python 3 should work. If you do not have Python installed, the latest version can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IT DOES:

This script is designed to extract the fifteen digit steam product codes from humblebundle.com or a similar digital storefront from a larger text input, usually a copy/paste of the webpage's contents, to make redeeming large numbers of product codes less tedious than manually selecting each code. It can be used in conjunction with the Augmented Steam browser plug-in to redeem product codes very quickly.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Enter the text which contains your activation codes in the input.txt file.

2) Save and close input.txt.

3) Run 'run_me.py' by double clicking the file, right clicking and selecting 'Open with Python 3.xx', or using Command Prompt.

4) Keys will be located in output.txt.

5a) If using Augmented Steam, copy the contents of output.txt to the 'activate multiple products' window on steam.com. This must be done in the web browser, not in the standalone storefront application.

5b) If not using Augmented Steam, enter each code into Steam's product activation field individually.
